## Unit 5.3 Async Classroom Guide

#### BEFORE YOU START:

 - Open the video link for today’s class: [https://youtu.be/zxJzVflgLD0](https://youtu.be/zxJzVflgLD0)
 - Be ready with your activity files from class. You will need them to complete the day’s activities.
 - Review the day’s objectives:
    - To prepare students to answer conceptual problems with visualization.
    - To reinforce visualization and pseudocoding as necessary tools for any web developer -- they’re essential for taking on any complex project as well as the tough questions they’ll attempt today (and during tech interviews).
 - Be sure to jot down any lingering questions that you’ll want to take to office-hours.

### 00:06 to 01:06 - Instructor Do: Welcome

Welcome to class!

Today, you're going to take on a slew of activities based on the kinds of questions you might face in job interviews for developer positions. Check out the early moments in this video to get the instructor's context on today's activities.

When you are ready, head on over to the next section for a warm-up activity.

### 01:12 to 05:20 - Groups Do: The Virtues of Visualizing Problems

How do you problem solve?

This first activity will walk you through a bit of a brain teaser that should get you thinking of ways to answer questions that you might not think have simple or obvious answers.

Watch the video through the timestamps indicated above to hear the instructor's context on this activity. Then, spend a bit of time writing out your response the following question:

  - What's the highest selling product in Walmart?

Don't Google the answer! Instead, think through the question. _Hint:_ Visualize yourself walking past those sliding doors and into this store. If you were making your weekly trip to Walmart, which item near the entrance would you gravitate toward?

When you are done, move on to the next section for a brief introduction to visualizations.

### 05:27 to 11:01 - Instructor Do: Explain Visualizations 

What the video through the timestamps indicated above to hear other student's responses to the question. How do they compare to your own?

Then, wait for the actual answer from the instructor. It's surprising! Or maybe it's not. Depends on if you guessed it right. More importantly, how did you come to your conclusion?

Job candidates in all fields often encounter so-called conceptual problems, questions that offer no certain means to find answers. You must visualize the problem, provide your solution and explain your thought process if you want to impress your interviewers.

This may seem a little abstract now, but getting in this mindset will help you through the next couple of sections. 

When you are ready, move on to the next activity for a similar warm-up, this time involving code.

### 11:07 to 13:28 - Groups Do: Missing Cards

Watch the video through the timestamps indicated above to get context on this exercise. For clarity, here is your prompt:

  - I give you an array of 51 cards. 
  - Each card contains two properties: the suit, and the title (a string of either a number or a ranking: king, ace, so on).
  - Fifty-two cards form a deck. But I gave you 51. One is missing! How do you find it?

Try to come up with the most efficient steps to solve this. _Hint:_ Using a for loop against an array of values is not the most efficient solution--what if the cards aren't sorted?

Remember to visualize the problem. When you think you've got got it, head over to the next section for to hear other students' approach to this problem.

### 13:35 to 23:24 - Instructor Do: Go Over Missing Cards 

To be fair, there are many solutions to the missing card question. The real outcome of this activity should be that it gets you thinking about the problem solving process.

Watch the video through the timestamps indicated above to review different students' approaches to this problem. Then, continue on to the next section to hear more about how this might apply in a job interview.

### 23:30 to 25:15 - Instructor Do: Explain The Interview Process

In this section, the instructor gives a bit more context on the types of questions you might expect to get during an interview. Keep in mind, your interview experience will differ depending on the organization and the position. Still, you should expect some general patterns to emerge. 

Check out the instructor's advice, then move on to the next section for an example commonly used in interviews.

### 25:22 to 28:53 - Groups Do: FizzBuzz  

You're now going to code out a very common programming activity: Fizz Buzz. Watch the video through the timestamps indicated above to get the instructor's context for this activity.

To help you keep track, here is a recap of the problem:

  - Write a script that prints the numbers 1 to 100 in the console. 
  - But for multiples of three, print Fizz instead of the number. 
  - For multiples of five, print Buzz. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five, print FizzBuzz.

Got all that? Give it a shot, then review your code in the following section.

### 29:00 to 38:51 - Instructor Do: Go Over FizzBuzz 

Watch the video through the timestamps indicated above to review the solution to this activity. How did you do? Take a moment to make any necessary corrections to your own solution. This will help you solidify your learning.

If you feel like you still need a slower paced recap of this activity, check out the [activity review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTart7fFefI).

When you are done, get ready for the next challenge: The Prime Checker.

### 38:58 to 39:31 - Students Do: Prime Checker

Heads up: The instructor video has changed! Do not worry, this is the same class content, but was recorded at a different time.

Watch the video through the timestamps indicated above to get the instructor's context for this activity. As before here is a recap of the problem:

  - Write a function that checks to see if a number is a prime number or not. Have it return true if it is, or false if it's not.

  - More info on Prime numbers: [https://www.mathsisfun.com/prime_numbers.html](https://www.mathsisfun.com/prime_numbers.html).

Once you've got it, head over to the next section to review your code.

### 39:37 to 40:43 - Instructor Do: Go Over Prime Number activity

Watch the video through the timestamps indicated above to review the solution to this activity. How did you do? Did other students approach this differently?

Remember to double-check your code. If there's a bug, debug it. This will help you solidify your understanding of these topics.

### 40:49 to 42:43 - Groups Do: File Sorter

Go to the timestamp above and listen to the instructor’s context on the jQuery calculator. You can follow along with `15-file_extension` from your class activity files. 

Then, complete the File sorter activity. _Hint:_ Look up JavaScript methods that would let them work with the specific characters in a string.

You can also rely on the following resource: [http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_obj_string.asp](http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_obj_string.asp)

### 42:23 to 42:50 - BREAK!

After you are done with the previous activity, take a break! When we come back, we'll be going over the solution, then moving on to the final topic of the day: Sorting algorithms.

### 42:50 to 59:12  - Instructor Do: Go Over File Sorter 

Watch the video through the timestamps indicated above to review the instructor's solution to this activity. Be sure to correct your own code as you view the solution.

Once you are done, get ready for the final activity of the day, the Bubble Sort algorithm.

### 59:18 to 01:03:45 - Groups Do: Bubble Sort 

Before getting started with this activity, it might be sueful to review this [resource on algorithms](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-algorithms-and-programs).

As you read, try to answer the following questions for yourself:
  - What is a computer algorithm?
  - How does an algorithm differ from a program?

Once you have understood this context, watch the video through the timestamps indicated above, to get context on this final activity. Follow along with your class activity files found in `13-bubble_sort`.

Do not Google the solution! It will be a disservice to your own learning. Give it your best shot. Then, when you have your answer, head on over to the final section review your code.

### 01:03:51 to 01:14:40 - Instructor Do: Go Over Bubble Sort + Class End

Watch the video through the timestamps indicated above to review the solution to the Bubble Sort activity. 

Remember, it's okay if your answer is not 100% correct. The key to showing your thought process to the interviewer--visualizing and the problem and pseudocoding the solution. If your pseudocode expresses the correct intent and logic, the code itself can be fixed and polished. This is the key to a successful interview.

## Unit 5.1 Async Classroom Guide

#### BEFORE YOU START:

 - Open the video link for today’s class: [https://youtu.be/erfuvqcTClA](https://youtu.be/erfuvqcTClA)
 - Be ready with your activity files from class. You will need them to complete the day’s activities.
 - Review the day’s objectives:
    - Students will ask conceptual questions regarding any of the subjects covered so far (HTML, CSS, Git, Github Pages, JavaScript, jQuery)
    - Students will absorb a high-level recap of the most important subjects covered to date.
    - Students will group code previous or new proj
 - Be sure to jot down any lingering questions that you’ll want to take to office-hours.

### 00:06 to 02:22 - Instructor Do: Cover Day's Agenda

Today will be a bit different. We will focus reviewing and recapping the lessons so far. The class will be divided into three sections.

  1. A few moments to answer lingering questions
  2. A high-level overview of all the major topics covered; and
  3. Two hours of coding in self directed exercises, either redoing select assignments or working on a new project.

Are you ready? Watch the video through the timestamps indicated above to get the instructor's context, then move on to the next section to reflect on feedback for the class.

### 02:29 to 15:40 -  Instructor Do: Collect Student Feedback

Before we get started with the review, watch the video through the timestamps indicated above. Then, reflect on the feedback that you would give the class so far. Is it too fast? Too slow? Too difficult?

Listen to the kinds of feedback from other students. Some of it may not be relevant to the pace of your own class. Some of it might reflect your feelings. We are always open to feedback, so please feel free to share any thoughts during Office-Hours or in a 1:1.

When you are done, head over to the next section for the day's review.

### 15:46 to 30:31 -  Instructor Do: Review 

Alright, it's time for review.

Watch the video through the timestamps indicated above to recap the lessons covered in class so far. Be proud of yourself, you've learned a lot in 4 weeks!

As always, be sure to take notes and take the time to research any topics that you'll need further clarification on.

Once you are ready, move on to the next section to get context on the day's activities.

### 30:37 to 33:02 - Instructor Do: Provide Activity Guidelines

Watch the video through the timestamps indicated above to get context on today's activities. 

To recap, here some questions to ask yourself before you pick a project:

  - Can you comfortably build the Word Guess Game (HW 3) from scratch?
    - No? Then start with Word Guess.
  
  - Can you conceptually explain how "Captain Planet The Game” works?
    - No? Then start by dissecting "Captain Planet the Game".

  - Can you comfortably use jQuery to modify HTML based on clicks?
    - No? Then start with Lottery Generator.

  - Can you comfortably create a grid-based design with Bootstrap?
    - No? Then start with the Bootstrap Portfolio assignment.

So? Where will you start? Take a moment to make your decision, then take a short break to stretch your legs, and get started!

### 33:09 to 35:03 -  Groups Do: Activities

There's no official "BREAK" for today's class. Instead, set aside two hours to start on the project of your choice. We recommend that you do the following:

  - Take a quick break before starting.
  - Work for 2 hours on the project of your choice. If you finish early, move on to the next one. Try to practice for all two hours. It's in your best interest!
  - Start from scratch. You are doing a disservice to yourself by not practicing, especially right now that the stakes are low. We are learning. Make all the mistakes now before you have to make them in a real job!

And that's it! Like we said, today's class is fairly open. Simply, work through this. When you are done, check out the final section to listen top some students reflect on their experience with these projects.

### 35:10 to 43:52 -  Everyone Do: Share Class Experience + Class Closing

In this final section, you'll be able to listen to students from a previous class reflect on their experience with these projects. Give it a watch, and take a moment to reflect on your own experience.  What might you still need help with?

Be sure to come to office-hours to clear any blockers in your progress.

Happy coding!

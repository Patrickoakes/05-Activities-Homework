## Unit 5.2 Async Classroom Guide

#### BEFORE YOU START:

 - Open the video link for today’s class: [https://youtu.be/5teLeegbzlk](https://youtu.be/5teLeegbzlk)
 - Be ready with your activity files from class. You will need them to complete the day’s activities.
 - Review the day’s objectives:
    - Reinforce your knowledge of JavaScript & jQuery.
    - Understand JavaScript Timing Events including setTimeout, clearTimeout, & setInterval.
    - Implement complex logical conditions to meet an objective.
 - Be sure to jot down any lingering questions that you’ll want to take to office-hours.

### 00:06 to 01:21 - Instructor Do: Welcome

Welcome to class!

We're keeping up the pace set by the previous class. There are no more slides for now. We're simply going to dive right in and keep pushing ourselves with a series of activities.

Watch the video through the timestamps indicated above to hear the instructor's context, then head over to the first warm-up activity.

### 01:35 to 04:10 - Students Do: Coin Flipper

Now that you have some experience with JavaScript functions and jQuery, these activities are going to start tossing new, albeit similar, concepts at you. Use your understanding of JavaScript Fundamentals to sort out the solution.

What the video through the timestamps indicated above to get context on this activity. Follow along with `04-CoinFlip` from your class activity files. Using the comments in the HTML file, complete the application.

For convenience, use these image files to represent each outcome:

  - If heads, use: http://random-ize.com/coin-flip/us-quarter/us-quarter-front.jpg
  - If tails, display: http://random-ize.com/coin-flip/us-quarter/us-quarter-back.jpg

When you are ready, head on over to the next section to review this solution with the class.

### 04:17 to 19:07 - Everyone Do: Coin Flipper Review + Recap

Watch the video through the timestamps indicated above to review the solution to this activity. How did you do? Take a moment to make any necessary corrections to your own solution. This will help you solidify your learning.

When you are done, get ready for a review activity on the concept of `this`.

### 19:13 to 19:35 - Groups Do: This

Before continuing, let's do another warm-up that will test your understanding of `this`.

What the video through the timestamps indicated above to get context on this activity. Follow along with `05-This` from your class activity files. You'll have to answer the questions in the HTML file.

When you are ready, head on over to the next section to review this answers to the activity.

### 19:41 to 29:37 - Everyone Do: This Review + Recap

Watch the video through the timestamps indicated above to review the solution to this activity. 

If you are still having a hard time wrapping your head around these concepts, take a moment to review the [MDN docs on `this`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this).

When you are ready, move on to the next section to learn about timers in JavaScript.

### 29:43 to 33:32 - Instructor Do: Timeout 

In this section, we will introduce the methods: `setTimeout` and `clearTimeout`.

Watch the video through the timestamps indicated above to get the instructor's context on how to use these methods. Then, get ready to pur these skills to the test in a simple timer activity.

### 33:38 to 34:23 - Students Do: Simple Timer 

What the video through the timestamps indicated above to get context on this activity. Follow along with `08-SimpleTimer` from your class activity files. Refer to the readme.md file for further instructions.

When you are ready, head on over to the next section check out the solution.

### 34:31 to 39:08 - Instructor Do: Simple Timer Recap

How did you do with this activity? Watch the video through the timestamps indicated above to review the solution with the rest of the class.

Still need help? Check out [w3schools reference on the subject](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_timing.asp).

### 39:15 to 39:57 - BREAK!

Time for a break. Take a few and stretch your legs. You've earned it.

After this, we'll be working on the jQuery calculator!

### 40:03 to 43:22 - Everyone Do: Intervals

This next activity will push your understanding of timing events in JavaScript.

Before getting started, open up `09-Interval` from your class activity files. Read through the `Unsolved` document and think about what's going on in this code.

When you are ready, watch the video through the timestamps indicated above to code the solution as a group. Remember, don't just watch the video. Build out the solution yourself and make sure that you have it working by the end of this section.

When you are done, head on over to the next for the final student activity of the day.

### 43:28 to 47:20 - Students Do: Stopwatch

It's time to put the lessons of the day together to create a functioning application, a stopwatch!

What the video through the timestamps indicated above to get context on this activity. Follow along with `10-Stopwatch` from your class activity files. Refer to the readme.md file for further instructions.

When you are ready, head on over to the next section check out the solution.

### 47:26 to  59:25 - Everyone Do: Stopwatch Review

How'd you do?

Watch the video through the timestamps indicated above to review your stopwatch. Take your time watching, and correct your own code as necessary. It'll help you understand this better.

Need a slower paced walk through? Watch the [video review](https://youtu.be/yKE7016Ioxc)

We are almost done! The final section is a bit more relaxed, and will give you an opportunity to apply these concepts once more to further solidify your learning.

### 59:32 to 01:12:10 - Everyone Do: Slideshow

As before, this will be a group coding activity. This time, apply the day's lessons to build an automated slideshow for your web pages.

Open up `11-Slideshow` from your class activity files to follow along as the instructor codes the solution. It is _critical_ that you actually code the solution yourself. Don't be a slacker, get it done!

When you are done, watch the final segment to close out the class for the day.

### 01:12:17 to 01:12:38 - Class End

Class is over!

As always, be sure to take the time to research any concepts that are still a little shaky for you. Still have questions? Come to office-hours. We're here to help.

Happy coding.
